# Basic HTML Website

This repository contains a small multi-page portfolio website built with HTML and a few CSS styles. The main goal was to create a semantic structure for the site and apply styling to the main page.

## Description

The website uses semantic sections for projects, articles, work experience, education, and contact. At the moment, only the main page is styled with CSS; the other pages keep structured HTML and will be styled in future updates.

## Styling applied

-   **Styled page:** `index.html` (styles located in `assets/style.css`, `assets/header.css`, `assets/footer.css`).
-   **Pages pending styling:** `projects.html`, `articles.html`, `contact.html` (will be updated later).

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilipeS0/portifolio-website
```

2. **Change into the project directory:**

```bash
cd basic-html-website
```

3. **Preview locally:**

-   Open `index.html` in your browser to see the main page with styles applied.
