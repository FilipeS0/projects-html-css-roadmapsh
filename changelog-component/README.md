# Changelog Component

Changelog Component is a small, responsive HTML + CSS component that presents a timeline-style changelog. It is designed to be quickly dropped into any static site or component library.

## Description

This repository contains a single-page demo of the `Changelog Component` built with semantic HTML and a focused CSS stylesheet located in `assets/style.css`.

## Features

-   Lightweight: plain HTML and CSS, no JavaScript required.
-   Responsive: uses fluid sizes and a max-width container.
-   Easy to reuse: timeline entries are simple `.log` blocks.

## Quick start

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the component.
