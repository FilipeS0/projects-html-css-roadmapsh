# Datepicker-UI

This repository is a small exercise that implements a static datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. The component is not interactive — it is a visual mockup you can later enhance with JavaScript.

In this project, you are required to create a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.

The goal of this exercise is to practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS. The provided markup and stylesheet demonstrate how to arrange inputs, icons, month controls and a calendar grid using modern layout methods.

## What to build

-   A compact header with date inputs and a calendar icon.
-   Month navigation with previous/next controls and the current month/year label.
-   A calendar grid showing day names and numbered day cells.
-   Responsive, well-structured CSS in `assets/style.css` using flexbox and CSS Grid.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser to view the static datepicker UI.

## Files

-   `index.html` — demo page with the datepicker markup
-   `assets/style.css` — styling for the component
-   `images/` — local images used by the UI
