# Testimonial Cards

This repository contains a small demo that teaches CSS layout and positioning by implementing a set of testimonial cards. The component is built with semantic HTML and a focused CSS stylesheet in `assets/style.css`.

## Project Goal

The purpose of this exercise is to learn different CSS layout and positioning techniques by creating several testimonial cards. Each card demonstrates a specific approach (floating elements, flexbox alignment, absolute positioning, responsive sizing, and layering) so you gain practical experience with:

-   layout and alignment using Flexbox
-   positioning elements (static, relative, absolute)
-   responsive sizing with `clamp()` and fluid units
-   creating card components and visual hierarchy

After completing the project you'll understand how to build responsive card layouts and how to use positioning to control element relationships.

## Features

-   Plain HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required)
-   Responsive design using fluid sizes and `clamp()`
-   Several card styles illustrating different layout techniques

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser to preview the testimonial cards.

## Exercise Notes

-   Try to replicate the mockup provided by the exercise to practice positioning and layout.
-   Focus on arranging text, images, and decorative elements (triangles, overlays) using CSS only.
-   Use the CSS file at `assets/style.css` to implement styling and experiment with `flex`, widths, `position`, and `clamp()` for responsive typography.
